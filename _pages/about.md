**About me**
I graduated from the School of Information Engineering in China University of Geosciences (Beijing).
I received the M.Eng and B.Eng from School of Information Engineering, CUGB. 

Recently, my interests focus on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for Optimization. where I exploit DRL methods to solve the classic Combinatorial Optimization Problems (such as Vehicle Routing Problem). It is a hot topic for both AI and Operations Research, quite interesting yet challenging. Welcome to use my CODE.
